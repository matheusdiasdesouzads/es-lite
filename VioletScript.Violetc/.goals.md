## Include/exclude sources

The compiler is able to include and exclude source files recursively. Excluding source files is often neccessary for excluding sources that are included by other sources through the `include './part.violet';` directive.

```
violetc -o code.violetc --include-sources src --exclude-sources src/parts
```

A single source file may be specified instead of a directory with both of the `--include-sources` and `--exclude-sources` options.
