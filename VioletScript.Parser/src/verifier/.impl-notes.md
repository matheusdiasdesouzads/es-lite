# Verifier notes

Some of the notes in this document also apply to bytecode import phase.

- [x] Enum definitions "override" the `valueOf()` and `toString()` methods.
- [ ] Prohibit destructuring patterns in class-block or enum-block variable definitions.
- [x] `typeExp.<>`: verify constraints
- [x] `exp.<>`: verify constraints
- [x] `v as T` or `v as? T` DO NOT turn `T` into `T?`; instead, verification for such conversion produces a `ConversionValue` with `isOptional` set to `true`, and `TypeConversions.convertExploicit(...)` will properly wrap `T` into `T?` if needed.
- [ ] Prohibit defining writeable variables for `[Value]` classes.
- [x] Instance methods can be overriden with additional optional parameters and a contravariant return type or any return type if the original return type is any.
- [ ] Decorators must not be allowed in certain places, like over ordinary functions and ordinary variables.
