# Verifier notes

Some of the notes in this document also apply to bytecode import phase.

- [ ] If `proxy::setIndex` or `proxy::deleteIndex` is defined, then `proxy::getIndex` must also be defined.
- [ ]  Prohibit destructuring patterns in class-block or enum-block variable definitions.
- [ ] `typeExp.<>`: verify constraints
- [ ] `exp.<>`: verify constraints
- [ ] `v as T` or `v as? T` DO NOT turn `T` into `T?`; instead, verification for such conversion produces a `ConversionValue` with `isOptional` set to `true`, and `TypeConversions.convertExploicit(...)` will properly wrap `T` into `T?` if needed.
- [ ] Prohibit writeable fields for `[Value]` classes.
- [ ] Prohibit use of `void` as type expression except as a function return type expression. Prohibit for getter to return `void` as well.
- [ ] Invoke `enumType.EnumInitializeMethods()` when appropriate.
- [ ] Subpackages should be defined with `AddSubpackage()`
- [ ] Do not allow to override a parameterized method.
- [ ] Call `AddLimitedKnownSubtype()` with classes and interfaces as appropriate.
- [ ] Decorators must not be allowed in certain places, like over ordinary functions and ordinary variables.
- [ ] The constructor of a value class must initialize all properties before using `this`.
