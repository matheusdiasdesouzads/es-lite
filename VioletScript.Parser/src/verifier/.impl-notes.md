# Verifier notes

Some of the notes in this document also apply to bytecode import phase.

- [x] Enum definitions "override" the `valueOf()` and `toString()` methods.
- [ ] If `proxy::deleteIndex` is defined, then `proxy::getIndex` must also be defined.
- [ ]  Prohibit destructuring patterns in class-block or enum-block variable definitions.
- [x] `typeExp.<>`: verify constraints
- [x] `exp.<>`: verify constraints
- [x] `v as T` or `v as? T` DO NOT turn `T` into `T?`; instead, verification for such conversion produces a `ConversionValue` with `isOptional` set to `true`, and `TypeConversions.convertExploicit(...)` will properly wrap `T` into `T?` if needed.
- [ ] Prohibit writeable fields for `[Value]` classes.
- [ ] Prohibit use of `void` as type expression except as a function return type expression. Prohibit for getter to return `void` as well.
- [x] Instance methods can be overriden with additional optional parameters and a contravariant return type or any return type if the original return type is any.
- [ ] Invoke `enumType.EnumInitializeMethods()` when appropriate.
- [ ] Call `AddLimitedKnownSubtype()` with classes, enums and interfaces as appropriate.
- [ ] Decorators must not be allowed in certain places, like over ordinary functions and ordinary variables.
- [ ] The constructor of a value class must initialize all properties before using `this`. A value class must not extend any class other than Object. A value class must have no `super()` statement.
